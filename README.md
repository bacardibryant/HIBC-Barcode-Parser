# Modulo43-Barcode-Parser
Parses Code 128 barcode values using the HIBCC® Modulo 43 standard. The barcode parser verifies the
"data" contained in the barcode text by validating the value calculated from the message contents, against
a "check digit" embedded within the message.

### Use Cases
The most common use cases are patient armband and healthcare product scanning. The check-digit verification ensures that the message contained is complete. Theoretically, this is in much the same way that we use the checksum validation in computer data files.
